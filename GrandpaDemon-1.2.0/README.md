## Overview
The humble Extreme Demon is the highest difficulty in all of Geometry Dash. **However, there is no possible way that Acheron and ACU should be considered the same difficulty.** Think that there should be more demon difficulties above Extreme? Look no further than the **Grandpa Demon mod!**

## Features
* *Up to 6 new demon difficulties* above Extreme Demon!
* *All Rated Extremes Demon List* integration for choosing the demon difficulties.
* *2.2 List support!*
* ***Grandpa Demon!***


**Additionally, the highest demon difficulties each have their own **animated backgrounds** and **particles** for the level page!*
